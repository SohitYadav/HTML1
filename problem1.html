    <h1>b tag</h1>
    <p>
        The  tag specifies bold text without any extra importance. Browsers will bold the text inside both of these tags the same, but the strong tag indicates that the text is of particular importance or urgency. You can also bold text with the CSS font-weight property set to â€œbold". The bold tag is written as <b></b> with the text to be bold inserted between the start and end tags.

    <h1>i tag</h1>
    <p>
        Known as Italic tag. This tag is generally used to display the technical term, phrase, the important word in a different language. The i tag is a container tag that contains the opening tag, content & closing tag. 
    </p>
    <h1>u tag</h1>
    <p>
        Known as Underline tag. This tag is generally used to underline misspelled words. This tag requires a starting as well as ending tag. The content inside is typically displayed with an underline.
    </p>
    <h1>select tag</h1>
    <p>
        The select element is used to create a drop-down list.

            The select element is most often used in a form, to collect user input.
            
            The name attribute is needed to reference the form data after the form is submitted (if you omit the name attribute, no data from the drop-down list will be submitted).
            
            The id attribute is needed to associate the drop-down list with a label.
            
            The option tags inside the select element define the available options in the drop-down list.
    </p>
    <h1>button tag</h1>
    <p>
        The button tag defines a clickable button.

            Inside a button element you can put text (and tags like i, b, strong, br, img, etc.). That is not possible with a button created with the input element! HTML Button tag can be used inside and outside the form.

            If you use it inside the form, it works as the submit button. You can also use it as reset button.
            
            If you use it outside the form, you can call JavaScript function on it.

    <h1>hr tag</h1>
    <p>
        The hr tag in HTML stands for horizontal rule and is used to insert a horizontal rule or a thematic break in an HTML page to divide or separate document sections. The hr tag is an empty tag, and it does not require an end tag.
    </p>
    <h1>br tag</h1>
    <p>
        The br HTML element produces a line break in text (carriage-return). It is useful for writing a poem or an address, where the division of lines is significant. The br tag is an empty tag which means that it has no end tag.
